"""The one embedding contract shared by training and inference.

Train and serve must turn audio into model-input vectors the **same** way, or the
linear heads see a different distribution at inference than they were fit on: the
classic *train/serve skew*. This module is the single place that produces a model
input, so the two paths cannot drift.

The contract has exactly one atomic unit:

  * :func:`embed_clip`: ONE audio span (a 1-D float array) -> ONE L2-normalized
    CLAP vector. This is the unit a head is **trained on** (one corpus clip) and
    **scored on** (one isolated span at inference). Both call this exact function.

A *recording* (an uploaded clip) usually contains several spans. Inference turns
it into the list of per-span vectors a head should score:

  * :func:`model_vectors`: a recording -> an (n_spans, dim) array, each row an
    :func:`embed_clip` of one span, plus the spans / clean-result for reporting.

Aggregation over those spans happens in **probability space** (mean of each
head's ``predict_proba``), never by averaging the vectors. Averaging
L2-normalized embeddings and renormalizing produces a vector the StandardScaler
and LogisticRegression never saw at fit time: exactly the skew this module
exists to prevent. Keeping every vector a single-span embedding makes train and
serve identical at the level that matters: what reaches the classifier.
